    <p> It might be said, however, that, in doing this, we were exciting unjust prejudices against our own West India planters; that our own colonial 
    institutions bear in themselves a much milder aspect than those of the French and Dutch, and are besides administered by Englishmen, in the sprit, and 
    according the the maxims, of English jurisprudence. We will not now stop to controvert the correctness of this statement; we will give our countrymen
    the benefit of the plea, so far at least to abstain, for the present, from illustrating our general position by facts drawn from the foreign colonies
    of the <placeName key="West Indies" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies""> West Indies. </placeName>

 The proofs already exhibited, in confirmation of it, have been drawn from the nature and effects of the slave system in the United States,
    the general spirit of whose legislation and jurisprudence us, to say no more, as liberal as our own; and we mean, in what follows to confine the examination 
    to the British islands. </p>
    <p> Here again, we propose to take a view of the state of slavery, which must be admitted, by West Indians themselves, to be the least unfavourable to the character of 
    their system. We shall not now have recourse to the writings of that able and faithful delineator of Negro slavery in our own islands, the 
    <persName key="Ramsay, James" from="1773" to="1789" role="abolitionist" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ramsay_(abolitionist)">

Rev. James Ramsay</persName>, because the scenes he witnessed, however they may serve to mark the genius of that institution, it might be alleged, are now upwards of forty years old. Neither shall we have recourse
    to any part of the evidence taken before the Privy Council, or before Parliament, when the question of the slave trade was first agitated in this country. We shall not even
    cite, in support of our general views, the testimony of <persName key="Pinckard, George" from="1768" to="1835" role="physician" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pinckard">  Dr. Pinckard </persName>; nor the recorded atrocities communicated by Lord Seaforth in 1803, as illustrative of the state of slavery
    in the oldest of our colonies, <placeName key="Barbados, West Indies" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados""> Barbadoes; </placeName>

 lest it should be argued, that these authorities do not apply the the actual existing state of things. </p>
